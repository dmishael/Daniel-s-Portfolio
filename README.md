MVP:
comPost is an app that makes it easy to re-use and recycle food waste in order to reduce methane emissions and slow down climate change. My MVP allows for gardens or individuals who compost to post when they have capacity and are in need of organic waste for feed stock and allows for individuals to help their favorite local gardens. 

Stretch Goal:
If I had more time I would have added a googlemaps API so individuals could easily get to and drop off their food waste.
